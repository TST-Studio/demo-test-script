## Sandbox / Testing Repo for tst-cli

`tst` is a tool from TST-Studio that **automatically generates unit tests for JavaScript and TypeScript code**, helping developers maintain flow, reduce boilerplate, and improve test coverage.  
Built with **TypeScript, Vitest, OCLIF, ts-morph, and LLMs (like OpenAI, Claude, etc)**.

This repository is a testing ground for testing the `tst` command.
